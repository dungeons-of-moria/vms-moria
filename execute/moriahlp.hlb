AAplayer  may  choose  from  a  number  of  races  and classes whenAcreating their character, and then 'run' that  character  over  aAperiod  of  days, weeks, even months;  attempting to win the game9by defeating the Balrog which lurks in the deeper levels.A     The player will begin his adventure on the town level  whereAhe  may  acquire supplies, weapons, armor, and magical devices byAbartering with various shop  owners.   After  preparing  for  hisAadventure,  the  player  can  descend  into the dungeons of MORIA,where fantastic adventures await his coming!<Before beggining your first adventure, you should read  thisAdocument carefully.  The game of MORIA is a complicated game, and'will require a dedicated player to win.ww≠ÄÿQ/∞áé1 ABBREVIATIONS     Weapons:          (DF) - Defender.          (FB) - Frost Brand.          (FT) - Flame Tongue.          (HA) - Holy Avenger.          (SD) - Slay Dragon.          (SE) - Slay Evil.          (SM) - Slay Monster.          (SU) - Slay Undead.     Armor:          (RA) - Resist Acid.          (RC) - Resist Cold.          (RF) - Resist Fire."

d  weapons,  he is ready to enter the dungeon.  Move onAtop of the '>'  symbol  and  use  the  down  '>'  command.   YourAcharacter enters a maze of interconnecting staircases and finallyApasses through a one-way door.  He is now on the first  level  ofAthe  dungeon  (50  feet),  and  must  survive  many  horrible and8challenging encounters to find the treasure lying about.2 Armor ClassA     Armor class is a number that describes the  amount  and  theAquality of armor begin worn.  Ar
mor class will generally run fromAabout 0 to 40, but could become negative or greater  than  40  inrare cases.A     The larger your armor class, the more protective it  is.   AAnegative  armor  class  would  actually  help get you hit.  ArmorAprotects you in three manners.  One, it makes you  harder  to  beAhit for damage.  A hit for no damage is the same as a miss.  Two,Agood armor will absorb some of the  damage  that  your  characterAwould  have  taken.  An armor class of 30 woul
d absorb 30% of anyAdamage meant for him.  Three, fire and acid damage are reduced byAwearing  body  armor.  It is obvious that a high armor class is a-must for surviving the lower levels of MORIA.A     Each piece of armor has an armor  class  adjustment,  and  aAmagical  bonus.   Armor  bought  in  town  will have these valuesAdisplayed with their description.  Armor that is found within theAdungeon must be identified before these values will be displayed.AArmor class values are always diplayed between a set of  bracketsA'[#,+#]'.   The  first value is the armor class of the item.  TheAsecond number is the magical bonus of the item, and  will  alwaysAhave a sign preceding the value.  There are a few cases where theAform '[+#]' is used, meaning the object has no armor class,  onlya magical armor bonus if worn.A     Some pieces of armor will possess special  abilites  denotedby the following abbreviations:     (RA) - Resist Acid.A         This magical ability is usually  enchanted  into  armor,A    but  may  occasionally be found as an ability of a weapon.  AA    character using such an  object  will  take  only  a  quarterA    damage  from any acid thrown upon him.  In addition, armor soA    enchanted will resist the acid's effects and not  be  damaged
    by it.     (RC) - Resist Cold.A         This magical ability is also found in both  weapons  andA    armor.  A character using a resist cold object will take only$    half damage from frost and cold.     (RF) - Resist Fire.A         This magical ability is found in both weapons and armor.A    A  character  using  a  resist fire object will take only one&    quarter damage from heat and fire.     (RL) - Resist Lightning.A         This magical ability is found in both weapons and armor.A    A  character  using  a resist lightning object will take only/    one quarter damage from electrical attacks.     (R) - Resistance.A         This  magical  ability  is  found  only  in  armor.    AA    character   wearing   armor   with  this  ability  will  haveA    resistance to Acid, Cold, Fire, and Lightning as explained in    each part above.	2 BashingA     Weight  is  the  primary  factor  in  being  able  to   bashAsomething,  but  strength  plays  a  role  too.  After bashing, aAcharacter may be off balance for several  rounds  depending  uponhis DEXTERITY.A     Doors can be broken down by bashing them.  Once  a  door  is8ba
shed open, it is forever useless and cannot be closed.A     Chests too may be  bashed  open,  but  be  warned  that  theAcareless  smashing  of a chest often ruins the contents.  BashingAopen a chest will not disarm any traps it may contain,  but  does2allow the strong and ignorant to see whats inside.A     Finally, a creature may be bashed.  If a shield is currentlyAbeing  worn,  the  bash is a shield bash and will do more damage.AIn either case, a bash may throw an opponent off  balance  for  aAnumber of rounds, allowing a player to get in a free hit or more.AIf the player is thrown off-balance, his opponent  may  get  free%hits on him.  This is a risky attack.2 Cursed ObjectsA     Some objects, mainly armor and weapons, have had curses laidAupon  them.   These  horrible  objects  will  look like any otherAnormal item, but will  detract  from  your  characters  stats  orAabilities  if worn.  They will also be impossible to remove untila remove curse is done.A     When a cursed item has been identified, an asterisk '*' willAappear  next  to the inventory letter of the item.  If you shouldAwear a cursed item, you will immediately know it  is  cursed  andagain the asterisk will appear.2 DeathA     If your character falls below 0 hit points, he has died  andAcannot  be  restored.  A tombstone showing information about yourAcharacter  will  be  displayed  with  the  option  to  print  theinformation to a file.A     After  the  tombstone,  the  toptwenty  list  of  heroes  isAdisplayed.   If  your  score  beats  any  of  the toptwenty, yourAcharacter will join this elite rank of heroes.  Otherwise,  well,there is always next time...
2 FightingA     Attacking is simple in MORIA.  If you move into a  creature,Ayou  attack  him.   You  can  attack  from a distance by firing aAmissile, or by magical means such as aiming  a  wand.   CreaturesAattack  in  the same way, if they move into you, they attack you.ASome cre
atures can cast spells from a distance, and  dragon  typeAcreatures  can  breath  from  a  distance, but these are the onlyexceptions.A     If you are wielding a weapon, the damage for the  weapon  isAused  when you hit the creature.  If you are wielding no weapons,Ayou get two fist strikes.  Note that very strong creatures can doAa  lot  of  damage  with  their  fists...  A character may have aAprimary and secondary weapon.  A secondary weapon is kept on  theAbelt,  or  on  the  sh
oulder  for  immediate use.  You can switchAbetween your primary and  secondary  weapons  by  using  the  'x'Acommand.   Be  sure  you  are  wielding  the  proper  weapon whenAfighting.  Hitting a dragon over the head with a bow will  simply!make him mad, and get you killed.A     Missile weapons, such as bows, can be wielded, and then  theAproper  missile,  in  this case an arrow, can be fired across theAroom into a target.  Missiles can  be  used  without  the  properAmissile  weapon,  but used together they have a greater range anddo far more damage.A     Hits and misses are determined by ability to  hit  VS  armorAclass.   A  miss  doesn't  necessarily mean you failed to hit theAtarget, but only that you failed to do any damage.   Therefore  aA'hit'  is  a  strike that does some damage.  Higher armor classes3make it harder to do damage, therefore more misses.2 LightA     There are two sources for light  once  inside  the  dungeon.APermanent light which 	has been magically placed within rooms, andAa light source carried by the player.  If neither is present, theAcharacter  will  be  unable to map or see any attackers.  Lack of?light will also affect searching, picking locks, and disarming.A     A character must wield a torch or lamp in  order  to  supplyAhis  own  light.   Once a torch or lamp has only 50 or less turnsAleft before burning out, the message "Your light is getting  low"Awill  be  displayed  at  random intervals.  Once a torch is burntAout, it is useless and can be dropped.  A lamp or lantern can  beArefilled  with  oil  by  using the Fill 'F' command.  You must of1course be carrying extra oil to refill a lantern.2 MiningA     Much of the treasure within the dungeon can be found only byAmining  it out of the walls.  Many rich strikes exist within eachAlevel, but must  be  found  and  mined.   Quartz  veins  are  theArichest,  yielding the most metals and gems, but magma veins willhave some hordes hidden within.A     Mining is virtually impossible without  a  pick  or  shovel.APicks and shovels have an additional magical ability expressed asA'(+#)'.  The higher the number, the better  the  magical  diggingAability of the tool.  Note that a pick or shovel also has plusses/to hit and damage, and can be used as a weapon.A     When a vein of quartz or magma  is  located,  the  characterAshould  wield his pick or shovel and begin digging out a section.AWhen that section is removed, he should locate another section ofAthe  vein,  and  begin  the process again.  Since granite rock isAmuch harder to dig through, it is much faster to follow the  vein#exactly and dig around the granite.A     If the character has a scroll or staff of treasure location,Ahe  can  immediately locate all strikes of treasure within a veinAshown on the screen.  This makes  mining  much  easier  and  moreprofitable.	2 ObjectsA     The mines are full of objects just waiting to be  pic
ked  upAand  used.   How  did  they get there?  Well, the main source forAuseful items are all the foolish adventurers that proceeded  intoAthe  dungeon  before  you.   They  get  killed,  and  the helpfulAmonsters scatter the various  treasure  throughout  the  dungeon.AMost  cursed items are placed there by the joyful evil sorcerers,.who enjoy a good joke when it gets you killed.A     You pick up objects by moving on top of them.  You can carryAup  to  22  different  items  in  your
  backpack while wearing andAwielding many others.  Note that although you are limited  to  22Adifferent  items,  you  may  be  carrying  several  of  each itemArestricted only by the amount of weight your character can carry.AYour  character's  weight  limit  is  determined by his Strength.AOnly one object may occupy any one given  floor  location,  whichAmay or may not also contain one monster.  Note that doors, traps,7and staircases are considered objects for this purpose.A     Man	!y objects found within the dungeon have special  commandsAfor their use.  Wands must be Aimed, staves must be Used, scrollsAmust be Read, and potions must be Quaffed.  In any case, you mustAfirst  be  able  to  carry an object before you can use it.  SomeAobjects, such as chests, are very complex.  Chests contain  otherAobjects  and  may  be  trapped,  and/or locked.  Read the list of@player commands carefully for a further understanding of chests.A     One item in particular will be di	"scussed here.   The  scrollAof "Word of Recall" can be found within the dungeon, or bought atAthe temple in town.  It acts in two manners, depending upon  yourAcurrent  location.   If read within the dungeon, it will teleportAyou back to town.  If read in town, it  will  teleport  you  backAdown to the deepest level of the dungeon one which your characterAhas previously been.  This  makes  the  scroll  very  useful  forAgetting  back to the deeper levels of MORIA.  Once the scroll hasA#been read it takes a while for the spell to act, so don't  expectit to save you in a crisis.A     And lastly, a final warning.  Not all objects are what  theyAseem.   Skeletons  lying  peacefully  about the dungeon have beenknown to get up...2 Secret DoorsA     Many secret doors are used within the dungeon to confuse andAdemoralize  adventurers  foolish  enough to enter.  But with someAluck, and lots of concentration, you can find these secret doors.A     Secret doors will som
$etimes hide rooms or corridors, or evenAentire  sections  of  that  level of the dungeon.  Sometimes they2simply hide small empty closets or even dead ends.A     Creatures in the dungeon will generally know  and  use  thisAsecret  doors.   If  they  leave one open, you will be able to goAright through it.  If they close it behind them you will have  toAsearch  for  the  catch  first.   Once  a  secret  door  has beenAdiscovered by you, it is drawn  as  a  known  door  and  no  more%se%arching will be required to use it.2 StaircasesA     Staircases are the manner in which you get deeper, or  climbAout  of  the dungeon.  The symbols for the up and down staircasesAare the same as the commands to use them.  A '<' represents an upAstaircase  and  a '>' represents a down staircase.  You must move:your character over the staircase before you can use them.A     Each level has at least one up staircase, and at  least  twoAdown  staircases.  There are no exceptions to this& rule.  You mayAhave trouble finding some  well  hidden  secret  doors,  but  thestairs are there.	2 WeaponsA     Carrying a weapon in your backpack does you  no  good.   YouAmust  wield a weapon before it can be used in a fight.  Note thatAa secondary weapon can be kept by wielding it and then using  theAexchange  command  'x'.  A secondary weapon is not in use, simply7ready to be switched with the current weapon if needed.A     Weapons have two main characteristics;  their abi'lity to hitAand their ability to do damage, expressed as '(+#,+#)'.  A normalAweapon would be '(+0,+0)'.  Many weapons in  MORIA  have  magical
     MORIAAbonuses  to  hit  and/or do damage.  Some weapons are cursed, andAhave penalties that hurt the player.   Note  that  cursed  swords/cannot be un-wielded until the curse is lifted.A     Missile  weapons,  such  as  bows,  have  only   one   majorAcharacteristic  which  is to hit, expressed '(+#)'.  This plus toAhit is  added  to  t(hat  of  the  missile  used,  if  the  proper%weapon/missiles combination are used.A     Although you recieve any  magical  bonuses  an  unidentifiedAweapon  may  possess when you weild it, those bonuses will not beAadded in to the displayed values of to-hit  and  to-dam  on  yourAcharacter  sheet.   You  must  identify  the  weapon  before  the.displayed values reflect the real values used.A     Finally, some rare weapons have special abilities.  This areAcalled  ego  weapons,  and)  are feared by great and meek.  An ego;sword must be wielded to receive benefit of it's abilities.@     Special weapons are denoted by the following abbreviations:     (DF) - DefenderA         A magical weapon that actually helps the wielder  defend-    himself, thus increasing his armor class.     (FB) - Frost BrandA         A magical weapon of ice that delivers a cold critical to    heat based creatures.     (FT) - Flame Tongue.A         A magical weapon of flame* that delivers a heat  critical    to cold based creatures.     (HA) - Holy Avenger.A         A Holy Avenger is by far the most powerful  of  weapons.A    Holy  Avengers  have  been  known  to increase several of theA    wielder's stats, to actually  increase  the  wielder's  armorA    class (because of the terror the weapon spawns in it's foes),?    and to actually help the wielder to fight more effectively.     (SD) - Slay Dragon.A         A Slay Dragon weapon is a special+ purpose  weapon  whoseA    sole  intent is to destroy dragon-kind.  Therefore, when usedA    against a dragon,  the  amount  of  damage  done  is  greatly    increased.     (SE) - Slay Evil.A         A Slay Evil weapon is a  special  purpose  weapon  whoseA    sole  intent  is  to  destroy  all  forms of evil.  When usedA    against an evil creature, either alive or undead, the  damage    done is greatly increased.     (SM) - Slay Monster.A         A Slay Monster weapon i,s a special purpose weapon  whoseA    sole intent is to destroy all the vile monsters of the world.A    A  monster  is  any  creature  not  natural  to  the   world.A    Therefore  an orc would be a monster, but a giant snake would    not be.     (SU) - Slay Undead.A         A Slay Undead weapon is a special purpose  weapon  whoseA    sole  intent  is to destroy all forms of undead.  This weaponA    is hated and feared by the intelligent undead, for  a  single8    blow from this- weapon is capable of destroying them.	2 WinningA     Once your character has progressed into killing dragons withAbut  a  mean  glance  and snap of his fingers, he may be ready toAtake on the Balrog.  The Balrog will appear on every level  after=level 49, so don't go down there until you are ready for him.A     The Balrog cannot be killed in some of  the  easier  methodsAused  on  normal  creatures.  Because of the Balrog's cunning, heAwill teleport away to another level if a spell
. such  as  genocideAis used upon him, and the Balrog cannot be polymorphed, slept, orAcharmed.  Magical spells like coldball are effective against  himAas  are  weapons,  but  he is difficult to kill and if allowed to#escape for a time can heal himself.A     If you should actually survive the attempt  of  killing  theABalrog,  you  will  recieve  the status of WINNER.  Since yo haveAdefeated the toughest monster alive, your character is  ready  toAretire  and  cannot  be  saved.   Wh/en  you  quit  the game, yourAcharacter recieves a surprise bonus score and is entered into thetoptwenty file.	2 WizardsA     There are rumors of MORIA Wizards which,  if  asked  nicely,Acan  explain  details  of the MORIA game that seem complicated toAbeginners.  In addition,  they  have  special  spells  which  canArestore characters lost by accident, such as power-outs and such.ww≠¿|û0∞áé1 CHARACTERA     All characters have six main attributes which  modify  th0eirAbasic   abilities.   These  six  attributes,  called  stats,  areASTRENGTH,  INTELLIGENCE,  WISDOM,  DEXTERITY,  CONSTITUTION,  andACHARISMA.   Stats  may  vary  from  3 as a minimum to 18/100 as aAmaximum.  Because adventurers of interest tend to be better  thanAaverage  characters, MORIA stats will average about 12.5, and areAfurther  adjusted  by  race  and  class.   Some  races  are  justAnaturally  better  at  being  certain  classes,  as will be shownlater.A     In additi	1on to the more visible stats,  each  character  hasAcertain  abilities  which  are  mainly determined by his race andAclass, but are also modified by his  stats.   The  abilities  areAFIGHTING,   THROWING/BOWS,   SAVING  THROW,  STEALTH,  DISARMING,9MAGICAL DEVICES, PERCEPTION, SEARCHING, and INFRA-VISION.A     Characters will be assigned an early history, with money andAa social class based on that history.  Starting money is assignedAbased on history, charisma, and somewhat upon the 2 average  of  aAcharacter's  stats.   A  character  with below average stats will<receive extra money to help him survive the first adventure.@    Each character will also have physical attributes such as  aArace, a height, weight, sex, and a physical description.  None ofAthese, except weight, play any part in the  game  other  than  toAgive  the  player  a "feeling" for his character.  Weight is used5for computing carrying capacity and also for BASHING.B      Finally each character
3 is assigned HIT POINTS based on theirArace,  class,  and constitution.  Spell casters will also recieveA"MANA" which is expended when casting spells.  MANA is  based  on.Wisdom for Priests and Intelligence for Mages.2 AbilitiesA     Characters possess nine different abilities which  can  helpAthem  to survive.  The starting abilities of characters are basedAupon the race and class of characters.  Abilities may be adjustedAby  high  or  low  stats,  or  may increase with the level of 4the
character.  - FightingA     Fighting is the ability to hit and do damage with weapons orAfists.   Normally a character gets a single blow from any weapon,Abut if his dexterity and strength are high enough, he may receiveAmore   blows  per  round  with  lighter  weapons.   Strength  andAdexterity both  modify  the  ability  to  hit  an  opponent.   In>addition this skill increases with the level of the character.  - Throwing/BowsA     Using stand-off missile  weapons  and5  throwing  objects  isAincluded  in  the  skill.   Different  stats  apply  to differentAweapons, but may modify the distance an object  is  thrown/fired,Athe  amount  of  damage  done, and the ability to hit a creature.5This skill increases with the level of the character.  - Saving ThrowA     A Saving Throw is the ability of a character to  resist  theAeffects  of a spell cast on him by another person/creature.  NoteAthat this does not include spells cast on the player by  his  6ownAstupidity,  such  as  quaffing  a  nasty  potion.   This  abilityAincreases with the level of the character,  but  then  most  highAlevel creatures are better at casting spells, so it tends to evenout.  - StealthA     The  ability  to  move  silently  about  is   very   useful.ACharacters   with   good   stealth  can  usually  surprise  theirAopponents, gaining the first blow.  Also, creatures may  fail  toAnotice  a stealthy character entirely, allowing a player to avoid7certain fights.  - DisarmingA     Disarming is the  ability  to  remove  traps  (safely),  andAincludes   picking  locks  on  traps  and  doors.   Note  that  aAsuccessful disarming will gain  the  character  some  experience.AThe  character  must have found a trap before it can be disarmed.ADexterity and intelligence both modify the ability to disarm, and7this ability increases with the level of the character.  - Using Magical DevicesA     Using a magical device such as  a8  wand  or  staff  requiresAexperience  and knowledge.  Spell users such as mages and priestsAare therefore much better at using a magical device  than  say  aAfighter.   This  skill is modified by intelligence, and increases with the level of the character.  - PerceptionA     Perception  is  the  ability  to  notice  something  withoutAactively  seeking it out.  This skill is based entirely upon race<and class, and will never improve unless magically enhanced.  - SearchingA9     To search is to actively look for secret doors, floor traps,Aand  traps  on  chests.   Rogues  are  the best at searching, butAmages,  rangers,  and  priests  are  good  at  it.   IntelligenceAmodifies  your  ability  of searching, and your ability will alsoincrease with your level.  - Infra VisionA     Infra-vision is the ability to see heat sources.  Since mostAof  the  dungeon is cool or cold, infra-vision will not allow theAplayer to see walls  and  objects.   Infra-visio:n  will  allow  aAcharacter  to  see  any  warm-blooded  creatures  up to a certainAdistance.  This ability works equally well with  or  with  out  aAlight  source.   Note  that the majority of Moria's creatures areAcold blooded, and will not be detected unless lit up by  a  lightsource.	2 ClassesA     Once a race has been chosen, you will need to pick a  class.ASome  classes  will  not  be  available  to  certain  races;  forAinstance a Half-Troll cannot become a Paladin.  For th;e first fewAadventures  it  is  suggested  that  you  run a warrior or rogue.ASpell casting classes tend to take much more experience with  thegame to keep them alive.  - WarriorA     A Warrior is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most  ofAhis  problems  by  cutting  them to pieces, but will occasionallyAfall back on the help of a magical device.  His prime  stats  areAStrength  and  Constitution, and a good Dexterity can really helpAat times.  A Warrior will be good at Fig<hting and  Throwing/Bows,but bad at most other skills.  - MageA     A Mage must live by his wits.  He cannot hope to simply hackAhis  way through the dungeon, and so must therefore use his magicAto defeat, deceive, confuse, and to escape with.  A mage  is  notAreally  complete without a golf-cart of magical devices to use inAaddition to his spells.  He can master the higher  level  magicalAdevices  far  easier  than  anyone  else, and has the best savingAthrow to resist effects =of spells cast at him.  Intelligence  andADexterity  are  his  primary stats.  There is no rule that says aAmage cannot become a good fighter, but spells are his true realm.
  - PriestA     A Priest is a character of holy devotion.  They explore  theAdungeon  only  to  destroy  the  evil  that  lurks within, and ifAtreasure just happens to fall into their packs;   well,  so  muchAmore  to the glory of their church!  Priests receive their spellsAfrom a diety, and therefore do not cho>ose which spells they  willAlearn.   He  is familiar with magical devices, preferring to callAthem instruments of god, but is not as good as a  mage  in  theirAuse.   Priests have good saving throws, and make decent fighters,Apreferring blunt weapons over edged ones.   Wisdom  and  Charismaare the priests primary stats.	  - RogueA     A Rogue is a character that prefers to live by his  cunning,Abut  is  capable  of fighting his way out of a tight spot.  He isAthe master of traps ?and locks, no device being impossible for himAto  over-come.   A rogue has a high stealth allowing him to sneakAaround many creatures without having to fight, or  sneak  up  andAget  the  first  blow.   A  rogue's perception is higher than anyAother class, and many times he will notice a trap or secret  doorAbefore  having  to  search.   A  rogue is better than warriors orApaladins with magical devices, but still can not  rely  on  theirAperformance.   A  rogue's  primary  stats  are  In@telligence  and
Dexterity.
  - RangerA     A Ranger is a fighter/mage.  He is a good fighter,  and  theAbest  of  the  classes  with a missile weapon such as a bow.  TheAranger learns spells much more slowly than a mage, but is capableAof learning all but the most powerful spell.  Because a ranger isAreally a dual class character, it  requires  more  experience  toAadvance  him.  A ranger has a good stealth, good perception, goodAsearching, a good saving throw, and is good with magAical devices.1His primary stats are Intelligence and Dexterity.  - PaladinA     A Paladin is a fighter/priest.  He is a very  good  fighter,Asecond  only  to  the warrior class, but not very good at missileAweapons.  He receives prayers at a slower pace  then the  priest,Aand   can  receive  all  but the most powerful prayer.  Because aApaladin is really  a  dual  class  character,  it  requires  moreAexperience  to  advance  him.  A paladin lacks much in the way ofAabilities.  BHe is poor at  stealth,  perception,  searching,  andAmagical  devices.  He has a decent saving throw due to his divine7alliance.  His primary stats are Strength and Charisma.2 RacesA     There are eight different races that you can choose from  inAMORIA.   Some races are restricted as to what profession they mayAbe, and each race has  it's  own  adjustments  to  a  character's
abilities.	  - HumanA     The human  is  the  base  character,  all  other  races  areAcompared  toC  him.  Human's can choose any class, and are averageAat everything.  Humans tend to go up levels faster than any otherArace, because of their shorter life-spans.  No racial adjustments$occur to character's choosing human.  - Half-ElfA     Half-elves tend to be smarter and faster than a  human,  butAnot  as  strong.   Half-elves  are  slightly better at searching,Adisarming, perception, stealth, and magic, but they  are  not  as7good at hand weapons.  Half-elves may choose any classD.  - ElfA     Elves are better magicians then humans, but not as  good  atAfighting.   They tend to be smarter and faster than either humansAor half-elves, and also have better wisdom.  Elves are better  atAsearching,  disarming,  perception,  stealth, and magic, but theyAare not as good at hand weapons.   Elves  may  choose  any  classexcept Paladin.  - HalflingA     Halflings, or Hobbits, are very good at bows, throwing,  andAhave  good  saving throws.  They also are veEry good at searching,Adisarming, perception,  and  stealth;   so  they  make  excellentAthieves (but prefer to be called burglars...).  They will be muchAweaker than humans, and no good at bashing.  Halflings have  fairAinfra-vision,  so  can  detect  warm  creatures  at  a  distance.=Halflings can choose between being a fighter, mage, or rogue.	  - GnomeA     Gnomes are smaller than dwarfs, but larger  than  halflings.AThey, like the halflings, live in the earth in burrow-like hom	Fes.AGnomes are practical jokers, so if they can kill something  in  aAhumorous  way,  so much the better.  Gnomes make excellent mages,Aand have very good saving throws.  They are  good  at  searching,Adisarming,  perception,  and  stealth.  They have lower strengthsAand constitutions then humans, so therefore do not make  as  goodAof  fighters.   Gnomes have fair infra-vision, so can detect warmAcreatures at a distance.  A gnome  may  choose  between  being  a fighter, mage, priest, oGr rogue.	  - DwarfA     Dwarves are the headstrong miners and  fighters  of  legend.ASince  dungeons  are  the  natural  home  of  a  dwarf,  they areAexcellent choices for a warrior or priest.  Dwarves  tend  to  beAstronger,  have  higher  constitutions,  but  are slower and lessAintelligent than humans.  Because they are so headstrong and  areAsomewhat  wise,  they  resist  spells  which  are  cast  on them.ADwarves  also  have   good   infra-vision   because   they   liveAundeHrground.  They do have one big draw-back though.  Dwarves areAloud-mouthed and proud, singing  in  loud  voices,  arguing  withAthemselves  for  no  good  reason,  screaming  out  challenges atAimagined foes.  In other words, dwarves have a miserable stealth.  - Half-OrcA     Half-Orcs make excellent fighters, and decent  priests,  butAare  terrible  at  magic.  They are as bad as dwarves at stealth,Aand horrible at searching, disarming, and perception.   Half-OrcsAare;   let's  faIce  it, ugly.  They tend to pay more for goods inAtown.  Half-Orcs do make good priest's and rogues, for the simpleAreason  that  Half-Orcs tend to have great constitutions and lotsof hit points.  - Half-TrollA     Half-Trolls are incredibly strong, and have the highest  hitApoints  of  any  character  race.   They are also very stupid andAslow.  They will make great fighters and iffy priests.  They  areAbad  at  searching, disarming, perception, and stealth.  They areAso ugly thJat a Half-Orc grimaces in their  presence.   They  alsohappen to be fun to run...2 SexA     You may choose to be either a male or  a  female  character.AOnly height and weight are affected by a character's sex.  FemaleAcharacters tend to be somewhat smaller  and  lighter  then  theirAmale counterparts.  No adjustments to stats or abilities are made"because of the sex of a character.2 StatsSTR - StrengthA     Strength is important in fighting with weapons, or  hand  toAhaKnd.   A  high strength can improve your chances of hitting, andAthe amount of damage done with each  hit.   Characters  with  lowAstrengths  may  receive  penalties.   Strength  is also useful in(tunneling, body and shield bashing, etc.INT - IntelligenceA     Intelligence is the prime stat of a mage,  or  magician.   AAhigh  intelligence  increases a mages chances of learning spells,Aand in gaining mana.  No spell  may  be  learned  by  mages  withAintelligences  under 8.  IntelligeLnce also modifies a character's,chance of disarming traps and picking locks.WIS - WisdomA     Wisdom is the  prime  stat  of  a  priest.   A  high  wisdomAincreases  the  chance  of  recieving  new spells from a priest'sAdiety, and in the  gaining  of  mana.   Wisdom  also  modifies  aAcharacter's  chance  of  resisting  magical  spells cast upon hisperson.DEX - DexterityA     Dexterity is the combination of agility  and  quickness.   AAhigh  dexterity  may allow a charactMer to get multiple blows withAlighter weapons, thus greatly increasing his kill power, and  mayAincrease  his  chances  of hitting with any weapon.  Dexterity is1also useful in picking locks and disarming traps.CON - ConstitutionA     Constitution is a characters ability  to  resist  damage  toAtheir  body,  and  to  recover from damage received.  Therefore aAcharacter with a high constitution will receive more hit  points,!and be more resistant to poisons.CHR - CharismaA  N   Charisma represents a character's personality,  as  well  asAphysical  looks.   A  character with a high charisma will receiveAbetter prices from store owners, whereas a character with a  veryAlow  charisma  will  be  robbed blind.  A high charisma will also.mean more money when the character starts out.ww≠ú1∞áé
1 COMMANDSA     All commands are  entered  by  pressing  a  single  key,  orAcontrol  sequence  (holding down the control key while pressing aAkey).  If a paOrticular command  requires  additional  action,  itAwill  be  prompted  for, with one exception.  When a direction isArequired, no prompt is given unless and until an illegal response	is given.2 DirectionsA     In the following instructions, the symbol <Dir> refers to  aAnumeric  direction  based on your keypad.  It is not valid to useAthe number '5' in this context.  One exception to  this  is  withAmovement, in which case '5' will rest the character for one turn.A     Commands Pwhich require a direction will not prompt  you  forAone,  unless  you  input  an  illegal  direction.   Just  enter a)direction after the entering the command.  Directions    \     |     /                 7    8    9               - 4         6 -                 1    2    3                /     |     \
2 MovementA     Movement is  accomplished  by  using  your  numeric  keypad.ASimply  press  a  number and your character will move one step inAthat direction.  Pressing a '5' 
Qis equivalent to waiting for  oneAround  (More  efficient  resting  over  long  periods  of time isAaccomplished by using the Rest command).  You can only move  ontoAand through floor spots, and only if they contain no creatures or*obstructing objects such as a closed door.A     Moving your character  one  step  at  a  time  can  be  timeAconsuming  and  boring, so a faster method has been supplied.  ByAusing the Move command '.', you may move  in  a  direction  untilAsomething  inter
Resting  happens.   For  instance, by pressing theAperiod key '.' followed by the direction 8, your character  wouldAcontinue  to  move  up the screen, only coming to a stop after at8least one condition is satisfied.  These conditions are:C  1.  A creature appears upon the screen, or a creature already  on      the screen moves.C  2.  You move next to an  object,  or  feature  such  as  a  door,      staircase, or trap.C  3.  You come to  a  wall,  and  have  more  than  one  choice S ofC      directions  from  which  to  continue,  or  are  in a dead in      passage.1  4.  You come to a junction of several passages.Movement    \     |     /             7    8    9A           - 4         6 -    5 rests the character for one turn.             1    2    3            /     |     \2 BASH  B <Dir> - BashA     The Bash command includes breaking open doors and chests, orAbashing an opponent.  Two main factors determine the ability of aAcharacter  to  basTh;   their  weight  and  their  strength.    InAaddition,  when  bashing  an  opponent, you will either perform aAbody bash, or if wielding a shield, perform a shield  bash  whichis more effective.A     Bashing a door can throw the character off-balance, but thisAwill  not  generally  be  a problem.  Doors that have been jammedAclosed with spikes can only be opened by bashing.   Locked  doorsAmay  also  be  bashed  open.   Note that bashing a door open willpermanently break it.A
U     Bashing a creature has effects on both the  player  and  hisAopponent.   Depending  on  a character's dexterity, he may or mayAnot be thrown off-balance allowing free moves to  his  opponents.AIf   the   bash  is  successful,  the  opponent  will  be  thrownAoff-balance for 1 to 3 turns, thus allowing  the  character  freehits or a chance to run.A     A player automatically performs a shield bash instead  of  aAbody  bash,  if  he is currently wearing a shield.  A shield bashAadVds the damage of a shield to that  of  the  bash,  so  is  moreAeffective.   Note  that  size and material both affect the damagethat a shield will do.2 CHARACTER/  C       - Print character (to screen or file)A     This  command  allows  the  player  to  either  display  hisAcharacter on the terminal screen, or to print an entire characterAinfo listing to a file.  If printed to a file, history, equipment)list, and an inventory list are included.2 DISARM  D <Dir> - Disarm aW trap.A     You can attempt to disarm floor traps,  or  trapped  chests.AIf  you fail to disarm a trap, there is a chance that you blunderAand set it off.  You can only disarm a  trap  on  a  chest  after#finding it with the search command.2 EAT  E       - Eat some food.A     A character must eat occasionally to remain effective.  As aAcharacter  grows  hungry,  a message will appear at the bottom ofAthe screen saying "Hungry".  If a character remains  hungry  long:enough, heX will become weak and eventually start fainting.2 FILL,  F       - Fill a lamp or lantern with oil.A     If your character is currently using a lamp for  light,  andAif  he has a flask of oil in inventory, he may refill the lamp byAusing this command.  A lamp is capable of a maximum of 5500 turns?of light, and each flask has 5000 turns of oil contained in it.
2 LOCATION%  L       - Display map co-ordinates.@     The  Location command will display your character's current@co-ordYinates  as  shown  on  a printed map (printed with the 'P'@command).  Sectors contain up to '44' rows by '99' columns each.@The  Location  command  will display the character's current row:and column map co-ordinates, as well as the sector number.2 PRINT  P       - Print map to file.A     The Print command will write an entire map  of  the  dungeonAfloor  explored to a file.  Since the dungeon floor is large, theAmap is broken up into sectors, each containing up to '44' rows by'99'Z columns.2 REST'  R       - Rest for a number of turns.A     You may rest one turn by pressing the '5' key.  Resting  forAlonger periods of time is accomplished by using the Rest command,Afollowed by the number of turns you want to rest your  character.AResting  will  continue until the specified duration has expired,Aor something to wake the character happens, such  as  a  creatureAwandering  by.   It  is  sometimes  a good idea to rest a beat-upAcharacter until he regains some [of his hit points, but be sure to&have plenty of food if you rest often.A     If you have accidently entered in a rest period  too  large,Aor  change  your mind about the resting period, you may wake your!character up by pressing any key.2 SEARCHMODE  S       - Search mode toggle.A     The Searching toggle will take the character into and out ofAsearching mode.  When first pressed, the message "Searching" willAappear at the bottom of the screen.  The character is now  takingA\two  turns  for each command, one for the command and one turn toAsearch about him.  Note that this means he is  taking  twice  theAtime to move about the dungeon, and therefore twice the food.  IfAa creature should happen by  or  attack  you,  search  mode  willAautomatically  shut  off.  Otherwise you may turn off search modeby again pressing the 'S' key.2 TUNNEL   T <Dir> - Tunnel through rock.A     Tunneling (Mining) is a very useful  art.   There  are  fourAkinds  of rock pre]sent in the dungeons of Moria;  Permanent Rock,AGranite Rock, Magma Intrusion, and Quartz Veins.  Permanent  RockAis exactly that, permanent.  Granite is very hard, therefore hardAto dig through, and  contains  no  valuable  metals.   Magma  andAQuartz  veins  are  softer and sometimes bare valuable metals andAgems, shown as a '$' or a '*' character.  You  can  tell  if  theAmetal  or  gems are embedded into the wall by trying to move onto@them.  If you can't move over them, you'll have ^to dig them out.A     Tunneling can be VERY difficult by hand, so when you dig  beAsure  to  wield  either  a shovel or a pick.  Magical shovels andApicks can be found which allow the wielder  to  dig  much  faster,than normal, and a good strength also helps.2 AIM  a <Dir> - Aim a wand.A     Wands must be aimed in a direction to be used.  Wands are  aAmagical  device  and therefore use the Magical Devices ability ofAthe player.  They will either affect  the  first  object/creat_ureAencountered,  or  affect anything in a given direction, dependingAupon the wand.  An obstruction such as door or wall will  general2stop the effects of a wand from traveling further.2 BROWSE  b       - Browse a book.A     You can  only  read  a  book  if  you  are  of  it's  realm.ATherefore  a  magic  user could read a magic book, but not a holyAbook.  Fighter's will not be able to read either  kind  of  book.AWhen  the  browse  command  is used, all of the spells or prayers`Acontained in the book along with information about  it,  such  asAit's level, the amount of mana used up in casting it, and whetherAor not you know the spell or prayer will be displayed.  There areAa  total  of  31  different  magical spells in four books, and 31!different prayers in three books.2 CLOSE  c <Dir> - Close a door.A     Non-intelligent and certain other creatures will not be ableAto  open  a  door.  Therefore shutting doors can be a life saver.AYou must be adjaceant to an open door, and you cannot close broken4doors.  Note that bashing a door open will break it.2 DROP.  d       - Drop an object from you inventory.A     You can drop a single object onto the floor beneath  you  ifAthat  floor  spot  does not already contain an object.  Note thatAdoors and traps are considered objects in  this  sense.   If  youAdrop  an  object  such  as  a  potion  or scroll, a single one isAdropped onto the floor at a time.  Group objects such  as  arrows'arbe all dropped at once onto the floor.2 EQUIPMENT3  e       - Display a list of equipment being used.A     Use the Equipment command  to  display  a  list  of  objectsAcurrently  being  used  by your character.  Note that each objectAhas a specific place were it is placed, and that only one  objectAof  each  type  may  be used at any one time;  excepting rings of(which two can be worn, one on each hand.2 FIRE&  f <Dir> - Throw an object/Use a bow.A     You  may  throw  any  o
cbject  carried  by  your   character.ADepending  upon  the  weight of an object, it may travel across aAroom or drop down beside you.  If you throw an object such as  an'arrow, only one will be used at a time.A     If you throw at a  creature,  your  chance  of  hitting  theAcreature  is  determined  by  your pluses to hit, your ability atAthrowing, and the objects pluses to hit.  Once  the  creature  isAhit,  the  object  may  or  may  not  do any actual damage to it.ACertain object
ds in the dungeon can do  great  amounts  of  damageAwhen  thrown,  but  it's  for you to figure out the obscure ones.AOil flasks are considered to be lit before thrown, therefore they1will do fire damage to a creature if they hit it.A     To use a bow with arrows, simply wield the bow and throw theAarrows.   Extra  pluses  to  damage  and  hitting  are  gained byAwielding the proper weapon and throwing the  corresponding  ammo.7A heavy crossbow with bolts for example, is a killer...e2 HELP)  h       - Enter the MORIA help library.A     A subprocess is spawned and the HELP utility entered.   HelpAon  individual commands may be displayed without actually exitingAyour game.  You may return to your game by entering a <CONTORL>-Z
character.2 INVENTORY4  i       - Display a list of objects being carried.A     The Inventory command displays a list of all  objects  beingAcarried,  but  are  not  in  current use.  You may carry up to 22Adifferent kinds of objectsf, not including those in your equipmentAlist.   Depending upon your strength, you will be able carry many3identical objects before hitting your weight limit.2 JAM*  j <Dir> - Jam a door with an iron spike.A     Most humanoid and many intelligent creatures can simply openAa  closed  door,  and  can  eventually get through a locked door.ATherefore you may spike a door in order to jam  it.   Each  spikeAused  on  a door will increase it's strength.  It is very easy toAjam a door so gmuch as to make it impossible for your character toAbash  it  down,  so  spike  doors wisely.  Note that the bigger aAcreature is, the easier it can bash a door down.  Therefore  fourAor  more  spikes  might be necessary to slow down a dragon, where#one spike would slow down a kobold.2 MAGIC  m       - Cast a magic spell.A     First, a character must have learned a spell before  he  canAcast it.  Next, when casting a spell, he must read the spell fromAa book, so a book containihng the spell must be in his  inventory.AEach  spell has a chance of failure which starts out fairly largeAbut decreases as a character gains levels.  If a  character  doesAnot  have the available mana, he increases his chance of failure,Aand gambles on losing a point of constitution.  Note that since aAcharacter  must read the spell from a book, he cannot be blind orAconfused when casting a spell,  and  there  must  be  some  lightpresent.2 LOOK   l <Dir> - Look in a direction.Ai     The Look command is useful in identifying the exact type  ofAobject  or  creature shown on the screen.  Also, if a creature isAon top of an object, the look command will  describe  both.   YouAcan  see  creatures  and  objects up to 200 feet away (20 units).ANote that you  may  freely  use  the  Look  command  without  the creatures getting a move on you.2 OPEN(  o <Dir> - Open a door, chest, or lock.A     To open an object such as a door or chest you must  use  theAOpen  commjand.   If  the  object is locked, the Open command willAattempt to pick the lock, based on  your  ability  at  disarming.ANote  that if an object is trapped and you open it, the trap willbe set off.2 PRAY  p       - Read a prayer.A     First, a character must have learned a prayer before he  canAread  it.   Next,  when  reading  a prayer, he must have the bookAcontaining the prayer in his inventory.  Each prayer has a chanceAof  failure  which  starts  out  fairly  large but deckreases as aAcharacter gains  levels.   If  a  character  does  not  have  theAavailable  mana,  he increases his chance of failure, and gamblesAon losing a point of constitution.  Note that since  a  characterAmust  read the prayer from a book, he cannot be blind or confused%and there must be some light present.2 QUAFF  q       - Quaff a potion.A     To drink a potion use the Quaff command.  A  potion  affectsAthe  player  in  some  manner.   The effects of the potion may be9limmediately noticed, or they may be subtle and unnoticed.2 READ  r       - Read a scroll.A     To read a scroll use the Read command.  A scroll  spell  hasAan  area  affect,  except in a few cases such as identify scrollsAwhich act on other objects.  Note that two scrolls, the  identifyAscroll  and  the  recharge  scroll, have titles which can be readAwithout setting them off, and by pressing <ESCAPE> can  be  savedfor future use.2 SEARCH)  s       - Search general area one mturn.A     The Search command can be used to locate  hidden  traps  andAsecret doors about the player.  Note that more than a single turnAof searching will be required in most cases.  You  should  alwaysAsearch  a  chest  before  trying  to  open  it  because  they aregenerally trapped.	2 TAKEOFF*  t       - Take off a piece of equipment.A     Use the Take-Off command to remove an object from  use,  andAreturn  it  to  your inventory.  Occasionally you will run into aAcursed intem which cannot be removed.   Cursed  items  are  always8bad, and can only be taken off after removing the curse.2 USE  u       - Use a staff.A     The Use command will activate a staff.  Like  scrolls,  mostAstaffs  have  an  area affect.  Becasue staffs are generally moreApowerful than most other items,  they  are  also  harder  to  use
correctly.	2 VERSION,  v       - Display current version of game.A     The Version command displays the  credits  for  the  currentversoion of Moria.2 WEAR0  w       - Wear or wield an item being carried.A     To wear or wield  an  object  in  your  inventory,  use  theAWear/Wield  command.  If an object is already in use for the sameAfunction, it  is  automatically  removed  first.   Note  that  an=objects bonuses cannot be gained until it is worn or wielded.
2 EXCHANGE3  x       - Exchange primary and secondary weapons.A     A secondary weapon is any weapon which may be needed  often.AInstead  of  searchingp  through  your  inventory, you may use theAexchange command to keep the weapon ready.  For instance, if  youAwanted  to  use your bow most of the time, but needed a sword forAclose combat, you  could  wield  your  sword,  use  the  exchangeAcommand to make it the secondary weapon, then wield your bow.  IfAthe sword was suddenly needed, simply use the exchange command to%switch between the bow and the sword.
2 IDENTIFY1  /       - Identify a character shown on screen.A     Use theq identify  command  to  find  out  what  a  characterAdisplayed  on  the  screen stands for.  For instance, by pressingA'/.', you can find out that the '.'  stands  for  a  floor  spot.AWhen  used  with  a  creature, the identify command will tell youAonly what class of  creature  the  symbol  stands  for,  not  theAspecific  creature,  therefore  use  the  look  command  for thisinformation.
2 COMMANDS'  ?       - Display a list of commands.A     The ?  command displays a one pagre quick reference help pageon the screen.2 REPEAT   ^M      - Repeat last message.A     The <Control>-M (Carriage-Return or Enter key) command  willAre-display  the  last  message printed on the message line at thetop of your screen.2 REDRAW  ^R      - Redraw the screen.>     To redraw the entire screen, use the <Control>-R command.2 QUIT)  ^Y      - Quit the game without saving.A     To exit the game  without  saving  your  character  use  theA<Control>-Y  commands.  Once exited in this manner, your characteris non-recoverable.2 SAVE2  ^Z      - Save your character and quit the game.A     To save your game so that it can be restarted later, use theA<Control>-Z  command.   The save file can be moved about at will,Abut do not edit it.  Note that a copy of a saved  character  will'not work after that character has died.2 SHELL  $       - Shell out of game.A     Use the Shell command '$' to temporarily exit  the  game  toAexecute  DCLt  commands.  You may re-enter the game by typing in alog command.2 UP"  <       - Go up an up-staircase.A     If you move onto an up-staircase you may use the '<' commandAto  go  up  one level.  There is always one staircase going up onAevery level except for the town level (this does  not  mean  it'sAeasy  to  find).

TheAtown  consists of six buildings each with an entrance, some townsA'people', and a wall which surrounds the town.   The  first  timeAyou  are  in  town it will be daytime, but you may return to findAthat darkness  has  fallen.   (Note  that  some  spells  may  actdifferently in the town le~vel.)2 BuildingsA     You may enter any of the  stores,  if  they  are  open,  andAbarter  with  the  owner for items you can afford.  But be warnedAthat the owners can easily be insulted, and may  even  throw  youAout  for a while if you insult them too often.  To enter a store,Asimply move onto  the  entrance  represented  by  the  numbers  1
through 6.A     Once inside a store, his inventory will appear on the screenAalong  with  a set of options for your character.  You may b
rowseAthe store's inventory if it takes more than one page to  display,Aand  you  may  sell  or purchase items in his inventory.  You canAexecute your inventory and equipment commands to see what you areAcarrying.  Not shown with the options are the wear, take-off, andAexchange commands which will also work, but were excluded to keepthe options simple.A     Stores do not always have everything in stock.  As the  gameAprogresses,  they  may  get new items so check from time to time.	ÄAAlso, if you sell them an item, it may get  sold  to  a  customerAwhile  you  are  adventuring so don't always expect to be able to get back anything you have sold.A     Store owners will not buy harmful or useless items.   If  anAobject is unidentified, they will pay you some base price for it.AOnce they have bought  it  they  will  immediately  identify  theAobject.   If  it  is  a  good  object,  they will add it to theirAinventory.  If it was a bad bargain, they simply throw  the Å itemAaway.   In  any  case,  you  may receive some knowledge of the ifanother is encountered.3 Alchemy shopA     The Alchemy Shop deals in all manner of potions and scrolls.*The entrance to the Alchemy Shop is a '5'.3 ArmoryA     The Armory is where the  town's  armor  is  fashioned.   AllAsorts  of  protective  gear  may  be  bought  and sold here.  The entrance to the Armory is a '2'.3 General StoreA     The  General  Store  sells  foods,  drinks,  some  clothing,AtorcÇhes, lamps, oil, and spikes.  All of these items, and others,Acan be sold back to the General store for money.  The entrance tothe General Store is a '1'.3 Magic User's ShopA     The Magic User's Shop is  the  most  expensive  of  all  theAstores.   It  deals  in  all  sorts of rings, wands, amulets, and1staves.  The entrance to the Magic Shop is a '6'.3 TempleA     The Temple deals in healing and restoration potions, as wellAas  bless scrolls, word-of-recall scrolls, some apprÉoved priestly3weapons, etc.  The entrance to the Temple is a '4'.3 Weaponsmith's ShopA     The Weaponsmith's Shop  is  where  the  town's  weapons  areAfashioned.   Hand  and  missile weapons may be purchased and soldAhere, along with arrows, bolts, and shots.  The entrance  to  theWeaponsmiths is a '3'.
2 SuppliesA     Your character will begin his adventure with  some  suppliesAalready  on  him.   Use  the  Inventory 'i' command to check whatAthese supplies are.  It will be neÑcessary to buy  other  suppliesAbefore  continuing into the dungeon, however, so be sure to entereach of the stores.
2 TownsmenA     The town contains many different kinds of people.  There areAthe street urchins, young children who will mob an adventurer forAmoney, and seem  to  come  out  of  the  woodwork  when  excited.ABlubbering Idiots which are a constant anoyance, but not harmful.APublic drunks which wander about the town singing, and are of  noAthreat to anyone.  Sneaky ro
Ögues, which hang about watching for aAlikely victim to mug.  And finally, what town would  be  completeAwithout  a  swarm  of  half  drunk  warriors, who take offense or&become annoyed just for the fun of it.A     Most of the towns people should be avoided  by  the  largestApossible  distance  when  you wander from store to store.  FightsAwill break out though, so be prepared.  Since your character grewAup  in  this  world  of  intrigue,  no  experience is awarded forkilling on the tÜown level.ww≠ÄÏè2∞áé	1 WEAPONS@     Weapons  are  divided  into  four classes, depending on how@they  are  wielded  and  used.
