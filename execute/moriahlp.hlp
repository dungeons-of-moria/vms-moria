1 ADVENTURING
     Once your character is adequately supplied with food, light,
armor,  and  weapons,  he is ready to enter the dungeon.  Move on
top of the '>'  symbol  and  use  the  down  '>'  command.   Your
character enters a maze of interconnecting staircases and finally
passes through a one-way door.  He is now on the first  level  of
the  dungeon  (50  feet),  and  must  survive  many  horrible and
challenging encounters to find the treasure lying about.

2 Armor Class
     Armor class is a number that describes the  amount  and  the
quality of armor begin worn.  Armor class will generally run from
about 0 to 40, but could become negative or greater  than  40  in
rare cases.

     The larger your armor class, the more protective it  is.   A
negative  armor  class  would  actually  help get you hit.  Armor
protects you in three manners.  One, it makes you  harder  to  be
hit for damage.  A hit for no damage is the same as a miss.  Two,
good armor will absorb some of the  damage  that  your  character
would  have  taken.  An armor class of 30 would absorb 30% of any
damage meant for him.  Three, fire and acid damage are reduced by
wearing  body  armor.  It is obvious that a high armor class is a
must for surviving the lower levels of MORIA.

     Each piece of armor has an armor  class  adjustment,  and  a
magical  bonus.   Armor  bought  in  town  will have these values
displayed with their description.  Armor that is found within the
dungeon must be identified before these values will be displayed.
Armor class values are always diplayed between a set of  brackets
'[#,+#]'.   The  first value is the armor class of the item.  The
second number is the magical bonus of the item, and  will  always
have a sign preceding the value.  There are a few cases where the
form '[+#]' is used, meaning the object has no armor class,  only
a magical armor bonus if worn.

     Some pieces of armor will possess special  abilites  denoted
by the following abbreviations:

     (RA) - Resist Acid.

         This magical ability is usually  enchanted  into  armor,
    but  may  occasionally be found as an ability of a weapon.  A
    character using such an  object  will  take  only  a  quarter
    damage  from any acid thrown upon him.  In addition, armor so
    enchanted will resist the acid's effects and not  be  damaged
    by it.

     (RC) - Resist Cold.

         This magical ability is also found in both  weapons  and
    armor.  A character using a resist cold object will take only
    half damage from frost and cold.

     (RF) - Resist Fire.

         This magical ability is found in both weapons and armor.
    A  character  using  a  resist fire object will take only one
    quarter damage from heat and fire.

     (RL) - Resist Lightning.

         This magical ability is found in both weapons and armor.
    A  character  using  a resist lightning object will take only
    one quarter damage from electrical attacks.

     (R) - Resistance.

         This  magical  ability  is  found  only  in  armor.    A
    character   wearing   armor   with  this  ability  will  have
    resistance to Acid, Cold, Fire, and Lightning as explained in
    each part above.

2 Bashing
     Weight  is  the  primary  factor  in  being  able  to   bash
something,  but  strength  plays  a  role  too.  After bashing, a
character may be off balance for several  rounds  depending  upon
his DEXTERITY.

     Doors can be broken down by bashing them.  Once  a  door  is
bashed open, it is forever useless and cannot be closed.

     Chests too may be  bashed  open,  but  be  warned  that  the
careless  smashing  of a chest often ruins the contents.  Bashing
open a chest will not disarm any traps it may contain,  but  does
allow the strong and ignorant to see whats inside.

     Finally, a creature may be bashed.  If a shield is currently
being  worn,  the  bash is a shield bash and will do more damage.
In either case, a bash may throw an opponent off  balance  for  a
number of rounds, allowing a player to get in a free hit or more.
If the player is thrown off-balance, his opponent  may  get  free
hits on him.  This is a risky attack.

2 Cursed Objects
     Some objects, mainly armor and weapons, have had curses laid
upon  them.   These  horrible  objects  will  look like any other
normal item, but will  detract  from  your  characters  stats  or
abilities  if worn.  They will also be impossible to remove until
a remove curse is done.

     When a cursed item has been identified, an asterisk '*' will
appear  next  to the inventory letter of the item.  If you should
wear a cursed item, you will immediately know it  is  cursed  and
again the asterisk will appear.

2 Death
     If your character falls below 0 hit points, he has died  and
cannot  be  restored.  A tombstone showing information about your
character  will  be  displayed  with  the  option  to  print  the
information to a file.

     After  the  tombstone,  the  toptwenty  list  of  heroes  is
displayed.   If  your  score  beats  any  of  the toptwenty, your
character will join this elite rank of heroes.  Otherwise,  well,
there is always next time...

2 Fighting
     Attacking is simple in MORIA.  If you move into a  creature,
you  attack  him.   You  can  attack  from a distance by firing a
missile, or by magical means such as aiming  a  wand.   Creatures
attack  in  the same way, if they move into you, they attack you.
Some creatures can cast spells from a distance, and  dragon  type
creatures  can  breath  from  a  distance, but these are the only
exceptions.

     If you are wielding a weapon, the damage for the  weapon  is
used  when you hit the creature.  If you are wielding no weapons,
you get two fist strikes.  Note that very strong creatures can do
a  lot  of  damage  with  their  fists...  A character may have a
primary and secondary weapon.  A secondary weapon is kept on  the
belt,  or  on  the  shoulder  for  immediate use.  You can switch
between your primary and  secondary  weapons  by  using  the  'x'
command.   Be  sure  you  are  wielding  the  proper  weapon when
fighting.  Hitting a dragon over the head with a bow will  simply
make him mad, and get you killed.

     Missile weapons, such as bows, can be wielded, and then  the
proper  missile,  in  this case an arrow, can be fired across the
room into a target.  Missiles can  be  used  without  the  proper
missile  weapon,  but used together they have a greater range and
do far more damage.

     Hits and misses are determined by ability to  hit  VS  armor
class.   A  miss  doesn't  necessarily mean you failed to hit the
target, but only that you failed to do any damage.   Therefore  a
'hit'  is  a  strike that does some damage.  Higher armor classes
make it harder to do damage, therefore more misses.

2 Light
     There are two sources for light  once  inside  the  dungeon.
Permanent light which has been magically placed within rooms, and
a light source carried by the player.  If neither is present, the
character  will  be  unable to map or see any attackers.  Lack of
light will also affect searching, picking locks, and disarming.

     A character must wield a torch or lamp in  order  to  supply
his  own  light.   Once a torch or lamp has only 50 or less turns
left before burning out, the message "Your light is getting  low"
will  be  displayed  at  random intervals.  Once a torch is burnt
out, it is useless and can be dropped.  A lamp or lantern can  be
refilled  with  oil  by  using the Fill 'F' command.  You must of
course be carrying extra oil to refill a lantern.

2 Mining
     Much of the treasure within the dungeon can be found only by
mining  it out of the walls.  Many rich strikes exist within each
level, but must  be  found  and  mined.   Quartz  veins  are  the
richest,  yielding the most metals and gems, but magma veins will
have some hordes hidden within.

     Mining is virtually impossible without  a  pick  or  shovel.
Picks and shovels have an additional magical ability expressed as
'(+#)'.  The higher the number, the better  the  magical  digging
ability of the tool.  Note that a pick or shovel also has plusses
to hit and damage, and can be used as a weapon.

     When a vein of quartz or magma  is  located,  the  character
should  wield his pick or shovel and begin digging out a section.
When that section is removed, he should locate another section of
the  vein,  and  begin  the process again.  Since granite rock is
much harder to dig through, it is much faster to follow the  vein
exactly and dig around the granite.

     If the character has a scroll or staff of treasure location,
he  can  immediately locate all strikes of treasure within a vein
shown on the screen.  This makes  mining  much  easier  and  more
profitable.

2 Objects
     The mines are full of objects just waiting to be  picked  up
and  used.   How  did  they get there?  Well, the main source for
useful items are all the foolish adventurers that proceeded  into
the  dungeon  before  you.   They  get  killed,  and  the helpful
monsters scatter the various  treasure  throughout  the  dungeon.
Most  cursed items are placed there by the joyful evil sorcerers,
who enjoy a good joke when it gets you killed.

     You pick up objects by moving on top of them.  You can carry
up  to  22  different  items  in  your backpack while wearing and
wielding many others.  Note that although you are limited  to  22
different  items,  you  may  be  carrying  several  of  each item
restricted only by the amount of weight your character can carry.
Your  character's  weight  limit  is  determined by his Strength.
Only one object may occupy any one given  floor  location,  which
may or may not also contain one monster.  Note that doors, traps,
and staircases are considered objects for this purpose.

     Many objects found within the dungeon have special  commands
for their use.  Wands must be Aimed, staves must be Used, scrolls
must be Read, and potions must be Quaffed.  In any case, you must
first  be  able  to  carry an object before you can use it.  Some
objects, such as chests, are very complex.  Chests contain  other
objects  and  may  be  trapped,  and/or locked.  Read the list of
player commands carefully for a further understanding of chests.

     One item in particular will be discussed here.   The  scroll
of "Word of Recall" can be found within the dungeon, or bought at
the temple in town.  It acts in two manners, depending upon  your
current  location.   If read within the dungeon, it will teleport
you back to town.  If read in town, it  will  teleport  you  back
down to the deepest level of the dungeon one which your character
has previously been.  This  makes  the  scroll  very  useful  for
getting  back to the deeper levels of MORIA.  Once the scroll has
been read it takes a while for the spell to act, so don't  expect
it to save you in a crisis.

     And lastly, a final warning.  Not all objects are what  they
seem.   Skeletons  lying  peacefully  about the dungeon have been
known to get up...

2 Secret Doors
     Many secret doors are used within the dungeon to confuse and
demoralize  adventurers  foolish  enough to enter.  But with some
luck, and lots of concentration, you can find these secret doors.

     Secret doors will sometimes hide rooms or corridors, or even
entire  sections  of  that  level of the dungeon.  Sometimes they
simply hide small empty closets or even dead ends.

     Creatures in the dungeon will generally know  and  use  this
secret  doors.   If  they  leave one open, you will be able to go
right through it.  If they close it behind them you will have  to
search  for  the  catch  first.   Once  a  secret  door  has been
discovered by you, it is drawn  as  a  known  door  and  no  more
searching will be required to use it.

2 Staircases
     Staircases are the manner in which you get deeper, or  climb
out  of  the dungeon.  The symbols for the up and down staircases
are the same as the commands to use them.  A '<' represents an up
staircase  and  a '>' represents a down staircase.  You must move
your character over the staircase before you can use them.

     Each level has at least one up staircase, and at  least  two
down  staircases.  There are no exceptions to this rule.  You may
have trouble finding some  well  hidden  secret  doors,  but  the
stairs are there.

2 Weapons
     Carrying a weapon in your backpack does you  no  good.   You
must  wield a weapon before it can be used in a fight.  Note that
a secondary weapon can be kept by wielding it and then using  the
exchange  command  'x'.  A secondary weapon is not in use, simply
ready to be switched with the current weapon if needed.

     Weapons have two main characteristics;  their ability to hit
and their ability to do damage, expressed as '(+#,+#)'.  A normal
weapon would be '(+0,+0)'.  Many weapons in  MORIA  have  magical
     MORIA
bonuses  to  hit  and/or do damage.  Some weapons are cursed, and
have penalties that hurt the player.   Note  that  cursed  swords
cannot be un-wielded until the curse is lifted.

     Missile  weapons,  such  as  bows,  have  only   one   major
characteristic  which  is to hit, expressed '(+#)'.  This plus to
hit is  added  to  that  of  the  missile  used,  if  the  proper
weapon/missiles combination are used.

     Although you recieve any  magical  bonuses  an  unidentified
weapon  may  possess when you weild it, those bonuses will not be
added in to the displayed values of to-hit  and  to-dam  on  your
character  sheet.   You  must  identify  the  weapon  before  the
displayed values reflect the real values used.

     Finally, some rare weapons have special abilities.  This are
called  ego  weapons,  and  are feared by great and meek.  An ego
sword must be wielded to receive benefit of it's abilities.

     Special weapons are denoted by the following abbreviations:

     (DF) - Defender

         A magical weapon that actually helps the wielder  defend
    himself, thus increasing his armor class.

     (FB) - Frost Brand

         A magical weapon of ice that delivers a cold critical to
    heat based creatures.

     (FT) - Flame Tongue.

         A magical weapon of flame that delivers a heat  critical
    to cold based creatures.

     (HA) - Holy Avenger.

         A Holy Avenger is by far the most powerful  of  weapons.
    Holy  Avengers  have  been  known  to increase several of the
    wielder's stats, to actually  increase  the  wielder's  armor
    class (because of the terror the weapon spawns in it's foes),
    and to actually help the wielder to fight more effectively.

     (SD) - Slay Dragon.

         A Slay Dragon weapon is a special purpose  weapon  whose
    sole  intent is to destroy dragon-kind.  Therefore, when used
    against a dragon,  the  amount  of  damage  done  is  greatly
    increased.

     (SE) - Slay Evil.

         A Slay Evil weapon is a  special  purpose  weapon  whose
    sole  intent  is  to  destroy  all  forms of evil.  When used
    against an evil creature, either alive or undead, the  damage
    done is greatly increased.

     (SM) - Slay Monster.

         A Slay Monster weapon is a special purpose weapon  whose
    sole intent is to destroy all the vile monsters of the world.
    A  monster  is  any  creature  not  natural  to  the   world.
    Therefore  an orc would be a monster, but a giant snake would
    not be.

     (SU) - Slay Undead.

         A Slay Undead weapon is a special purpose  weapon  whose
    sole  intent  is to destroy all forms of undead.  This weapon
    is hated and feared by the intelligent undead, for  a  single
    blow from this weapon is capable of destroying them.

2 Winning
     Once your character has progressed into killing dragons with
but  a  mean  glance  and snap of his fingers, he may be ready to
take on the Balrog.  The Balrog will appear on every level  after
level 49, so don't go down there until you are ready for him.

     The Balrog cannot be killed in some of  the  easier  methods
used  on  normal  creatures.  Because of the Balrog's cunning, he
will teleport away to another level if a spell such  as  genocide
is used upon him, and the Balrog cannot be polymorphed, slept, or
charmed.  Magical spells like coldball are effective against  him
as  are  weapons,  but  he is difficult to kill and if allowed to
escape for a time can heal himself.

     If you should actually survive the attempt  of  killing  the
Balrog,  you  will  recieve  the status of WINNER.  Since yo have
defeated the toughest monster alive, your character is  ready  to
retire  and  cannot  be  saved.   When  you  quit  the game, your
character recieves a surprise bonus score and is entered into the
toptwenty file.

2 Wizards
     There are rumors of MORIA Wizards which,  if  asked  nicely,
can  explain  details  of the MORIA game that seem complicated to
beginners.  In addition,  they  have  special  spells  which  can
restore characters lost by accident, such as power-outs and such.

1 CHARACTER
     All characters have six main attributes which  modify  their
basic   abilities.   These  six  attributes,  called  stats,  are
STRENGTH,  INTELLIGENCE,  WISDOM,  DEXTERITY,  CONSTITUTION,  and
CHARISMA.   Stats  may  vary  from  3 as a minimum to 18/100 as a
maximum.  Because adventurers of interest tend to be better  than
average  characters, MORIA stats will average about 12.5, and are
further  adjusted  by  race  and  class.   Some  races  are  just
naturally  better  at  being  certain  classes,  as will be shown
later.

     In addition to the more visible stats,  each  character  has
certain  abilities  which  are  mainly determined by his race and
class, but are also modified by his  stats.   The  abilities  are
FIGHTING,   THROWING/BOWS,   SAVING  THROW,  STEALTH,  DISARMING,
MAGICAL DEVICES, PERCEPTION, SEARCHING, and INFRA-VISION.

     Characters will be assigned an early history, with money and
a social class based on that history.  Starting money is assigned
based on history, charisma, and somewhat upon the  average  of  a
character's  stats.   A  character  with below average stats will
receive extra money to help him survive the first adventure.

    Each character will also have physical attributes such as  a
race, a height, weight, sex, and a physical description.  None of
these, except weight, play any part in the  game  other  than  to
give  the  player  a "feeling" for his character.  Weight is used
for computing carrying capacity and also for BASHING.

      Finally each character is assigned HIT POINTS based on their
race,  class,  and constitution.  Spell casters will also recieve
"MANA" which is expended when casting spells.  MANA is  based  on
Wisdom for Priests and Intelligence for Mages.

2 Abilities
     Characters possess nine different abilities which  can  help
them  to survive.  The starting abilities of characters are based
upon the race and class of characters.  Abilities may be adjusted
by  high  or  low  stats,  or  may increase with the level of the
character.

  - Fighting

     Fighting is the ability to hit and do damage with weapons or
fists.   Normally a character gets a single blow from any weapon,
but if his dexterity and strength are high enough, he may receive
more   blows  per  round  with  lighter  weapons.   Strength  and
dexterity both  modify  the  ability  to  hit  an  opponent.   In
addition this skill increases with the level of the character.

  - Throwing/Bows

     Using stand-off missile  weapons  and  throwing  objects  is
included  in  the  skill.   Different  stats  apply  to different
weapons, but may modify the distance an object  is  thrown/fired,
the  amount  of  damage  done, and the ability to hit a creature.
This skill increases with the level of the character.

  - Saving Throw

     A Saving Throw is the ability of a character to  resist  the
effects  of a spell cast on him by another person/creature.  Note
that this does not include spells cast on the player by  his  own
stupidity,  such  as  quaffing  a  nasty  potion.   This  ability
increases with the level of the character,  but  then  most  high
level creatures are better at casting spells, so it tends to even
out.

  - Stealth

     The  ability  to  move  silently  about  is   very   useful.
Characters   with   good   stealth  can  usually  surprise  their
opponents, gaining the first blow.  Also, creatures may  fail  to
notice  a stealthy character entirely, allowing a player to avoid
certain fights.

  - Disarming

     Disarming is the  ability  to  remove  traps  (safely),  and
includes   picking  locks  on  traps  and  doors.   Note  that  a
successful disarming will gain  the  character  some  experience.
The  character  must have found a trap before it can be disarmed.
Dexterity and intelligence both modify the ability to disarm, and
this ability increases with the level of the character.

  - Using Magical Devices

     Using a magical device such as  a  wand  or  staff  requires
experience  and knowledge.  Spell users such as mages and priests
are therefore much better at using a magical device  than  say  a
fighter.   This  skill is modified by intelligence, and increases
with the level of the character.

  - Perception

     Perception  is  the  ability  to  notice  something  without
actively  seeking it out.  This skill is based entirely upon race
and class, and will never improve unless magically enhanced.

  - Searching

     To search is to actively look for secret doors, floor traps,
and  traps  on  chests.   Rogues  are  the best at searching, but
mages,  rangers,  and  priests  are  good  at  it.   Intelligence
modifies  your  ability  of searching, and your ability will also
increase with your level.

  - Infra Vision

     Infra-vision is the ability to see heat sources.  Since most
of  the  dungeon is cool or cold, infra-vision will not allow the
player to see walls  and  objects.   Infra-vision  will  allow  a
character  to  see  any  warm-blooded  creatures  up to a certain
distance.  This ability works equally well with  or  with  out  a
light  source.   Note  that the majority of Moria's creatures are
cold blooded, and will not be detected unless lit up by  a  light
source.

2 Classes
     Once a race has been chosen, you will need to pick a  class.
Some  classes  will  not  be  available  to  certain  races;  for
instance a Half-Troll cannot become a Paladin.  For the first few
adventures  it  is  suggested  that  you  run a warrior or rogue.
Spell casting classes tend to take much more experience with  the
game to keep them alive.

  - Warrior

     A Warrior is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most  of
his  problems  by  cutting  them to pieces, but will occasionally
fall back on the help of a magical device.  His prime  stats  are
Strength  and  Constitution, and a good Dexterity can really help
at times.  A Warrior will be good at Fighting and  Throwing/Bows,
but bad at most other skills.

  - Mage

     A Mage must live by his wits.  He cannot hope to simply hack
his  way through the dungeon, and so must therefore use his magic
to defeat, deceive, confuse, and to escape with.  A mage  is  not
really  complete without a golf-cart of magical devices to use in
addition to his spells.  He can master the higher  level  magical
devices  far  easier  than  anyone  else, and has the best saving
throw to resist effects of spells cast at him.  Intelligence  and
Dexterity  are  his  primary stats.  There is no rule that says a
mage cannot become a good fighter, but spells are his true realm.

  - Priest

     A Priest is a character of holy devotion.  They explore  the
dungeon  only  to  destroy  the  evil  that  lurks within, and if
treasure just happens to fall into their packs;   well,  so  much
more  to the glory of their church!  Priests receive their spells
from a diety, and therefore do not choose which spells they  will
learn.   He  is familiar with magical devices, preferring to call
them instruments of god, but is not as good as a  mage  in  their
use.   Priests have good saving throws, and make decent fighters,
preferring blunt weapons over edged ones.   Wisdom  and  Charisma
are the priests primary stats.

  - Rogue

     A Rogue is a character that prefers to live by his  cunning,
but  is  capable  of fighting his way out of a tight spot.  He is
the master of traps and locks, no device being impossible for him
to  over-come.   A rogue has a high stealth allowing him to sneak
around many creatures without having to fight, or  sneak  up  and
get  the  first  blow.   A  rogue's perception is higher than any
other class, and many times he will notice a trap or secret  door
before  having  to  search.   A  rogue is better than warriors or
paladins with magical devices, but still can not  rely  on  their
performance.   A  rogue's  primary  stats  are  Intelligence  and
Dexterity.

  - Ranger

     A Ranger is a fighter/mage.  He is a good fighter,  and  the
best  of  the  classes  with a missile weapon such as a bow.  The
ranger learns spells much more slowly than a mage, but is capable
of learning all but the most powerful spell.  Because a ranger is
really a dual class character, it  requires  more  experience  to
advance  him.  A ranger has a good stealth, good perception, good
searching, a good saving throw, and is good with magical devices.
His primary stats are Intelligence and Dexterity.

  - Paladin

     A Paladin is a fighter/priest.  He is a very  good  fighter,
second  only  to  the warrior class, but not very good at missile
weapons.  He receives prayers at a slower pace  then the  priest,
and   can  receive  all  but the most powerful prayer.  Because a
paladin is really  a  dual  class  character,  it  requires  more
experience  to  advance  him.  A paladin lacks much in the way of
abilities.  He is poor at  stealth,  perception,  searching,  and
magical  devices.  He has a decent saving throw due to his divine
alliance.  His primary stats are Strength and Charisma.

2 Races
     There are eight different races that you can choose from  in
MORIA.   Some races are restricted as to what profession they may
be, and each race has  it's  own  adjustments  to  a  character's
abilities.

  - Human

     The human  is  the  base  character,  all  other  races  are
compared  to  him.  Human's can choose any class, and are average
at everything.  Humans tend to go up levels faster than any other
race, because of their shorter life-spans.  No racial adjustments
occur to character's choosing human.

  - Half-Elf

     Half-elves tend to be smarter and faster than a  human,  but
not  as  strong.   Half-elves  are  slightly better at searching,
disarming, perception, stealth, and magic, but they  are  not  as
good at hand weapons.  Half-elves may choose any class.

  - Elf

     Elves are better magicians then humans, but not as  good  at
fighting.   They tend to be smarter and faster than either humans
or half-elves, and also have better wisdom.  Elves are better  at
searching,  disarming,  perception,  stealth, and magic, but they
are not as good at hand weapons.   Elves  may  choose  any  class
except Paladin.

  - Halfling

     Halflings, or Hobbits, are very good at bows, throwing,  and
have  good  saving throws.  They also are very good at searching,
disarming, perception,  and  stealth;   so  they  make  excellent
thieves (but prefer to be called burglars...).  They will be much
weaker than humans, and no good at bashing.  Halflings have  fair
infra-vision,  so  can  detect  warm  creatures  at  a  distance.
Halflings can choose between being a fighter, mage, or rogue.

  - Gnome

     Gnomes are smaller than dwarfs, but larger  than  halflings.
They, like the halflings, live in the earth in burrow-like homes.
Gnomes are practical jokers, so if they can kill something  in  a
humorous  way,  so much the better.  Gnomes make excellent mages,
and have very good saving throws.  They are  good  at  searching,
disarming,  perception,  and  stealth.  They have lower strengths
and constitutions then humans, so therefore do not make  as  good
of  fighters.   Gnomes have fair infra-vision, so can detect warm
creatures at a distance.  A gnome  may  choose  between  being  a
fighter, mage, priest, or rogue.

  - Dwarf

     Dwarves are the headstrong miners and  fighters  of  legend.
Since  dungeons  are  the  natural  home  of  a  dwarf,  they are
excellent choices for a warrior or priest.  Dwarves  tend  to  be
stronger,  have  higher  constitutions,  but  are slower and less
intelligent than humans.  Because they are so headstrong and  are
somewhat  wise,  they  resist  spells  which  are  cast  on them.
Dwarves  also  have   good   infra-vision   because   they   live
underground.  They do have one big draw-back though.  Dwarves are
loud-mouthed and proud, singing  in  loud  voices,  arguing  with
themselves  for  no  good  reason,  screaming  out  challenges at
imagined foes.  In other words, dwarves have a miserable stealth.

  - Half-Orc

     Half-Orcs make excellent fighters, and decent  priests,  but
are  terrible  at  magic.  They are as bad as dwarves at stealth,
and horrible at searching, disarming, and perception.   Half-Orcs
are;   let's  face  it, ugly.  They tend to pay more for goods in
town.  Half-Orcs do make good priest's and rogues, for the simple
reason  that  Half-Orcs tend to have great constitutions and lots
of hit points.

  - Half-Troll

     Half-Trolls are incredibly strong, and have the highest  hit
points  of  any  character  race.   They are also very stupid and
slow.  They will make great fighters and iffy priests.  They  are
bad  at  searching, disarming, perception, and stealth.  They are
so ugly that a Half-Orc grimaces in their  presence.   They  also
happen to be fun to run...

2 Sex
     You may choose to be either a male or  a  female  character.
Only height and weight are affected by a character's sex.  Female
characters tend to be somewhat smaller  and  lighter  then  their
male counterparts.  No adjustments to stats or abilities are made
because of the sex of a character.


2 Stats
STR - Strength

     Strength is important in fighting with weapons, or  hand  to
hand.   A  high strength can improve your chances of hitting, and
the amount of damage done with each  hit.   Characters  with  low
strengths  may  receive  penalties.   Strength  is also useful in
tunneling, body and shield bashing, etc.

INT - Intelligence

     Intelligence is the prime stat of a mage,  or  magician.   A
high  intelligence  increases a mages chances of learning spells,
and in gaining mana.  No spell  may  be  learned  by  mages  with
intelligences  under 8.  Intelligence also modifies a character's
chance of disarming traps and picking locks.

WIS - Wisdom

     Wisdom is the  prime  stat  of  a  priest.   A  high  wisdom
increases  the  chance  of  recieving  new spells from a priest's
diety, and in the  gaining  of  mana.   Wisdom  also  modifies  a
character's  chance  of  resisting  magical  spells cast upon his
person.

DEX - Dexterity

     Dexterity is the combination of agility  and  quickness.   A
high  dexterity  may allow a character to get multiple blows with
lighter weapons, thus greatly increasing his kill power, and  may
increase  his  chances  of hitting with any weapon.  Dexterity is
also useful in picking locks and disarming traps.

CON - Constitution

     Constitution is a characters ability  to  resist  damage  to
their  body,  and  to  recover from damage received.  Therefore a
character with a high constitution will receive more hit  points,
and be more resistant to poisons.

CHR - Charisma

     Charisma represents a character's personality,  as  well  as
physical  looks.   A  character with a high charisma will receive
better prices from store owners, whereas a character with a  very
low  charisma  will  be  robbed blind.  A high charisma will also
mean more money when the character starts out.

1 COMMANDS
     All commands are  entered  by  pressing  a  single  key,  or
control  sequence  (holding down the control key while pressing a
key).  If a particular command  requires  additional  action,  it
will  be  prompted  for, with one exception.  When a direction is
required, no prompt is given unless and until an illegal response
is given.

2 Directions
     In the following instructions, the symbol <Dir> refers to  a
numeric  direction  based on your keypad.  It is not valid to use
the number '5' in this context.  One exception to  this  is  with
movement, in which case '5' will rest the character for one turn.

     Commands which require a direction will not prompt  you  for
one,  unless  you  input  an  illegal  direction.   Just  enter a
direction after the entering the command.

  Directions    \     |     /
                 7    8    9
               - 4         6 -
                 1    2    3
                /     |     \

2 Movement
     Movement is  accomplished  by  using  your  numeric  keypad.
Simply  press  a  number and your character will move one step in
that direction.  Pressing a '5' is equivalent to waiting for  one
round  (More  efficient  resting  over  long  periods  of time is
accomplished by using the Rest command).  You can only move  onto
and through floor spots, and only if they contain no creatures or
obstructing objects such as a closed door.

     Moving your character  one  step  at  a  time  can  be  time
consuming  and  boring, so a faster method has been supplied.  By
using the Move command '.', you may move  in  a  direction  until
something  interesting  happens.   For  instance, by pressing the
period key '.' followed by the direction 8, your character  would
continue  to  move  up the screen, only coming to a stop after at
least one condition is satisfied.  These conditions are:

  1.  A creature appears upon the screen, or a creature already  on
      the screen moves.
  2.  You move next to an  object,  or  feature  such  as  a  door,
      staircase, or trap.
  3.  You come to  a  wall,  and  have  more  than  one  choice  of
      directions  from  which  to  continue,  or  are  in a dead in
      passage.
  4.  You come to a junction of several passages.

Movement    \     |     /
             7    8    9
           - 4         6 -    5 rests the character for one turn.

            /     |     \

2 BASH
  B <Dir> - Bash

     The Bash command includes breaking open doors and chests, or
bashing an opponent.  Two main factors determine the ability of a
character  to  bash;   their  weight  and  their  strength.    In
addition,  when  bashing  an  opponent, you will either perform a
body bash, or if wielding a shield, perform a shield  bash  which
is more effective.

     Bashing a door can throw the character off-balance, but this
will  not  generally  be  a problem.  Doors that have been jammed
closed with spikes can only be opened by bashing.   Locked  doors
may  also  be  bashed  open.   Note that bashing a door open will
permanently break it.

     Bashing a creature has effects on both the  player  and  his
opponent.   Depending  on  a character's dexterity, he may or may
not be thrown off-balance allowing free moves to  his  opponents.
If   the   bash  is  successful,  the  opponent  will  be  thrown
off-balance for 1 to 3 turns, thus allowing  the  character  free
hits or a chance to run.

     A player automatically performs a shield bash instead  of  a
body  bash,  if  he is currently wearing a shield.  A shield bash
adds the damage of a shield to that  of  the  bash,  so  is  more
effective.   Note  that  size and material both affect the damage
that a shield will do.

2 CHARACTER
  C       - Print character (to screen or file)

     This  command  allows  the  player  to  either  display  his
character on the terminal screen, or to print an entire character
info listing to a file.  If printed to a file, history, equipment
list, and an inventory list are included.

2 DISARM
  D <Dir> - Disarm a trap.

     You can attempt to disarm floor traps,  or  trapped  chests.
If  you fail to disarm a trap, there is a chance that you blunder
and set it off.  You can only disarm a  trap  on  a  chest  after
finding it with the search command.

2 EAT
  E       - Eat some food.

     A character must eat occasionally to remain effective.  As a
character  grows  hungry,  a message will appear at the bottom of
the screen saying "Hungry".  If a character remains  hungry  long
enough, he will become weak and eventually start fainting.

2 FILL
  F       - Fill a lamp or lantern with oil.

     If your character is currently using a lamp for  light,  and
if  he has a flask of oil in inventory, he may refill the lamp by
using this command.  A lamp is capable of a maximum of 5500 turns
of light, and each flask has 5000 turns of oil contained in it.

2 LOCATION
  L       - Display map co-ordinates.

     The Location command will display your  character's  current
co-ordinates  as  shown  on  a  printed map (printed with the 'P'
command).  Sectors contain up to 44 rows by 99 columns each.  The
Location  command  will  display  the character's current row and
column map co-ordinates, as well as the sector number.

2 PRINT
  P       - Print map to file.

     The Print command will write an entire map  of  the  dungeon
floor  explored to a file.  Since the dungeon floor is large, the
map is broken up into sectors each containing up to 44 rows by 99
columns.

2 REST
  R       - Rest for a number of turns.

     You may rest one turn by pressing the '5' key.  Resting  for
longer periods of time is accomplished by using the Rest command,
followed by the number of turns you want to rest your  character.
Resting  will  continue until the specified duration has expired,
or something to wake the character happens, such  as  a  creature
wandering  by.   It  is  sometimes  a good idea to rest a beat-up
character until he regains some of his hit points, but be sure to
have plenty of food if you rest often.

     If you have accidently entered in a rest period  too  large,
or  change  your mind about the resting period, you may wake your
character up by pressing any key.

2 SEARCHMODE
  S       - Search mode toggle.

     The Searching toggle will take the character into and out of
searching mode.  When first pressed, the message "Searching" will
appear at the bottom of the screen.  The character is now  taking
two  turns  for each command, one for the command and one turn to
search about him.  Note that this means he is  taking  twice  the
time to move about the dungeon, and therefore twice the food.  If
a creature should happen by  or  attack  you,  search  mode  will
automatically  shut  off.  Otherwise you may turn off search mode
by again pressing the 'S' key.

2 TUNNEL
  T <Dir> - Tunnel through rock.

     Tunneling (Mining) is a very useful  art.   There  are  four
kinds  of rock present in the dungeons of Moria;  Permanent Rock,
Granite Rock, Magma Intrusion, and Quartz Veins.  Permanent  Rock
is exactly that, permanent.  Granite is very hard, therefore hard
to dig through, and  contains  no  valuable  metals.   Magma  and
Quartz  veins  are  softer and sometimes bare valuable metals and
gems, shown as a '$' or a '*' character.  You  can  tell  if  the
metal  or  gems are embedded into the wall by trying to move onto
them.  If you can't move over them, you'll have to dig them out.

     Tunneling can be VERY difficult by hand, so when you dig  be
sure  to  wield  either  a shovel or a pick.  Magical shovels and
picks can be found which allow the wielder  to  dig  much  faster
than normal, and a good strength also helps.

2 AIM
  a <Dir> - Aim a wand.

     Wands must be aimed in a direction to be used.  Wands are  a
magical  device  and therefore use the Magical Devices ability of
the player.  They will either affect  the  first  object/creature
encountered,  or  affect anything in a given direction, depending
upon the wand.  An obstruction such as door or wall will  general
stop the effects of a wand from traveling further.

2 BROWSE
  b       - Browse a book.

     You can  only  read  a  book  if  you  are  of  it's  realm.
Therefore  a  magic  user could read a magic book, but not a holy
book.  Fighter's will not be able to read either  kind  of  book.
When  the  browse  command  is used, all of the spells or prayers
contained in the book along with information about  it,  such  as
it's level, the amount of mana used up in casting it, and whether
or not you know the spell or prayer will be displayed.  There are
a  total  of  31  different  magical spells in four books, and 31
different prayers in three books.

2 CLOSE
  c <Dir> - Close a door.

     Non-intelligent and certain other creatures will not be able
to  open  a  door.  Therefore shutting doors can be a life saver.
You must be adjacent to an open door, and you cannot close broken
doors.  Note that bashing a door open will break it.

2 DROP
  d       - Drop an object from you inventory.

     You can drop a single object onto the floor beneath  you  if
that  floor  spot  does not already contain an object.  Note that
doors and traps are considered objects in  this  sense.   If  you
drop  an  object  such  as  a  potion  or scroll, a single one is
dropped onto the floor at a time.  Group objects such  as  arrows
are all dropped at once onto the floor.

2 EQUIPMENT
  e       - Display a list of equipment being used.

     Use the Equipment command  to  display  a  list  of  objects
currently  being  used  by your character.  Note that each object
has a specific place were it is placed, and that only one  object
of  each  type  may  be used at any one time;  excepting rings of
which two can be worn, one on each hand.

2 FIRE
  f <Dir> - Throw an object/Use a bow.

     You  may  throw  any  object  carried  by  your   character.
Depending  upon  the  weight of an object, it may travel across a
room or drop down beside you.  If you throw an object such as  an
arrow, only one will be used at a time.

     If you throw at a  creature,  your  chance  of  hitting  the
creature  is  determined  by  your pluses to hit, your ability at
throwing, and the objects pluses to hit.  Once  the  creature  is
hit,  the  object  may  or  may  not  do any actual damage to it.
Certain objects in the dungeon can do  great  amounts  of  damage
when  thrown,  but  it's  for you to figure out the obscure ones.
Oil flasks are considered to be lit before thrown, therefore they
will do fire damage to a creature if they hit it.

     To use a bow with arrows, simply wield the bow and throw the
arrows.   Extra  pluses  to  damage  and  hitting  are  gained by
wielding the proper weapon and throwing the  corresponding  ammo.
A heavy crossbow with bolts for example, is a killer...

2 HELP
  h       - Enter the MORIA help library.

     A subprocess is spawned and the HELP utility entered.   Help
on  individual commands may be displayed without actually exiting
your game.  You may return to your game by entering a <CONTORL>-Z
character.

2 INVENTORY
  i       - Display a list of objects being carried.

     The Inventory command displays a list of all  objects  being
carried,  but  are  not  in  current use.  You may carry up to 22
different kinds of objects, not including those in your equipment
list.   Depending upon your strength, you will be able carry many
identical objects before hitting your weight limit.

2 JAM
  j <Dir> - Jam a door with an iron spike.

     Most humanoid and many intelligent creatures can simply open
a  closed  door,  and  can  eventually get through a locked door.
Therefore you may spike a door in order to jam  it.   Each  spike
used  on  a door will increase it's strength.  It is very easy to
jam a door so much as to make it impossible for your character to
bash  it  down,  so  spike  doors wisely.  Note that the bigger a
creature is, the easier it can bash a door down.  Therefore  four
or  more  spikes  might be necessary to slow down a dragon, where
one spike would slow down a kobold.

2 MAGIC
  m       - Cast a magic spell.

     First, a character must have learned a spell before  he  can
cast it.  Next, when casting a spell, he must read the spell from
a book, so a book containing the spell must be in his  inventory.
Each  spell has a chance of failure which starts out fairly large
but decreases as a character gains levels.  If a  character  does
not  have the available mana, he increases his chance of failure,
and gambles on losing a point of constitution.  Note that since a
character  must read the spell from a book, he cannot be blind or
confused when casting a spell,  and  there  must  be  some  light
present.

2 LOOK
  l <Dir> - Look in a direction.

     The Look command is useful in identifying the exact type  of
object  or  creature shown on the screen.  Also, if a creature is
on top of an object, the look command will  describe  both.   You
can  see  creatures  and  objects up to 200 feet away (20 units).
Note that you  may  freely  use  the  Look  command  without  the
creatures getting a move on you.

2 OPEN
  o <Dir> - Open a door, chest, or lock.

     To open an object such as a door or chest you must  use  the
Open  command.   If  the  object is locked, the Open command will
attempt to pick the lock, based on  your  ability  at  disarming.
Note  that if an object is trapped and you open it, the trap will
be set off.

2 PRAY
  p       - Read a prayer.

     First, a character must have learned a prayer before he  can
read  it.   Next,  when  reading  a prayer, he must have the book
containing the prayer in his inventory.  Each prayer has a chance
of  failure  which  starts  out  fairly  large but decreases as a
character gains  levels.   If  a  character  does  not  have  the
available  mana,  he increases his chance of failure, and gambles
on losing a point of constitution.  Note that since  a  character
must  read the prayer from a book, he cannot be blind or confused
and there must be some light present.

2 QUAFF
  q       - Quaff a potion.

     To drink a potion use the Quaff command.  A  potion  affects
the  player  in  some  manner.   The effects of the potion may be
immediately noticed, or they may be subtle and unnoticed.

2 READ
  r       - Read a scroll.

     To read a scroll use the Read command.  A scroll  spell  has
an  area  affect,  except in a few cases such as identify scrolls
which act on other objects.  Note that two scrolls, the  identify
scroll  and  the  recharge  scroll, have titles which can be read
without setting them off, and by pressing <ESCAPE> can  be  saved
for future use.

2 SEARCH
  s       - Search general area one turn.

     The Search command can be used to locate  hidden  traps  and
secret doors about the player.  Note that more than a single turn
of searching will be required in most cases.  You  should  always
search  a  chest  before  trying  to  open  it  because  they are
generally trapped.

2 TAKEOFF
  t       - Take off a piece of equipment.

     Use the Take-Off command to remove an object from  use,  and
return  it  to  your inventory.  Occasionally you will run into a
cursed item which cannot be removed.   Cursed  items  are  always
bad, and can only be taken off after removing the curse.

2 USE
  u       - Use a staff.

     The Use command will activate a staff.  Like  scrolls,  most
staffs  have  an  area affect.  Becasue staffs are generally more
powerful than most other items,  they  are  also  harder  to  use
correctly.

2 VERSION
  v       - Display current version of game.

     The Version command displays the  credits  for  the  current
version of Moria.

2 WEAR
  w       - Wear or wield an item being carried.

     To wear or wield  an  object  in  your  inventory,  use  the
Wear/Wield  command.  If an object is already in use for the same
function, it  is  automatically  removed  first.   Note  that  an
objects bonuses cannot be gained until it is worn or wielded.

2 EXCHANGE
  x       - Exchange primary and secondary weapons.

     A secondary weapon is any weapon which may be needed  often.
Instead  of  searching  through  your  inventory, you may use the
exchange command to keep the weapon ready.  For instance, if  you
wanted  to  use your bow most of the time, but needed a sword for
close combat, you  could  wield  your  sword,  use  the  exchange
command to make it the secondary weapon, then wield your bow.  If
the sword was suddenly needed, simply use the exchange command to
switch between the bow and the sword.

2 IDENTIFY
  /       - Identify a character shown on screen.

     Use the identify  command  to  find  out  what  a  character
displayed  on  the  screen stands for.  For instance, by pressing
'/.', you can find out that the '.'  stands  for  a  floor  spot.
When  used  with  a  creature, the identify command will tell you
only what class of  creature  the  symbol  stands  for,  not  the
specific  creature,  therefore  use  the  look  command  for this
information.

2 COMMANDS
  ?       - Display a list of commands.

     The ?  command displays a one page quick reference help page
on the screen.

2 REPEAT
  ^M      - Repeat last message.

     The <Control>-M (Carriage-Return or Enter key) command  will
re-display  the  last  message printed on the message line at the
top of your screen.

2 REDRAW
  ^R      - Redraw the screen.

     To redraw the entire screen, use the <Control>-R command.

2 QUIT
  ^Y      - Quit the game without saving.

     To exit the game  without  saving  your  character  use  the
<Control>-Y  command.  Once exited in this manner, your character
is non-recoverable.

2 SAVE
  ^Z      - Save your character and quit the game.

     To save your game so that it can be restarted later, use the
<Control>-Z  command.   The save file can be moved about at will,
but do not edit it.  Note that a copy of a saved  character  will
not work after that character has died.

2 SHELL
  $       - Shell out of game.

     Use the Shell command '$' to temporarily exit  the  game  to
execute  DCL  commands.  You may re-enter the game by typing in a
log command.

2 UP
  <       - Go up an up-staircase.

     If you move onto an up-staircase you may use the '<' command
to  go  up  one level.  There is always one staircase going up on
every level except for the town level (this does  not  mean  it's
easy  to  find).   Going up a staircase will always take you to a
new dungeon area except for the town  level,  which  remains  the
same for the duration of your character.

2 DOWN
  >       - Go down a down-staircase.

     If you are on top of a down-staircase you may  use  the  '>'
command  to  go  down  one  level.  There are always two or three
staircases going down on each level, except the town level  which
has  only  one.  Going down will always take you to a new dungeon
area.

2 GO
  . <Dir> - Move in direction.

     The  Move  command  '.'  will  move  you  in  the  indicated
direction   until   one  of  several  conditions  happen.   These
conditions  include,  a  creature  appearing  on  the  screen,  a
creature  already on the screen moving, an object or feature such
as a door, a staircase, or a trap is adjacent to  the  character,
character  comes  into a junction of passages, or character comes
to a wall with no choice or more than one  choice  of  continuing
directions.

1 SUMMARY
     The game of MORIA is a single player dungeon simulation.   A
player  may  choose  from  a  number  of  races  and classes when
creating their character, and then 'run' that  character  over  a
period  of  days, weeks, even months;  attempting to win the game
by defeating the Balrog which lurks in the deeper levels.

     The player will begin his adventure on the town level  where
he  may  acquire supplies, weapons, armor, and magical devices by
bartering with various shop  owners.   After  preparing  for  his
adventure,  the  player  can  descend  into the dungeons of MORIA
where fantastic adventures await his coming!

Before beggining your first adventure, you should read  this
document carefully.  The game of MORIA is a complicated game, and
will require a dedicated player to win.

1 SYMBOLS
     Symbols  on  your  map  can  be  broken  down   into   three
categories;  Features of the dungeon such as walls, floor, doors,
and traps;  Objects which can be  picked  up  such  as  treasure,
weapons, magical devices, etc;  and Monsters which may or may not
move  about  the  dungeon,  but  are  mostly  harmful   to   your
character's well being.

     Note that some symbols can be in  more  than  one  category.
Also  note  that treasure may be imbedded in a wall, and the wall
must be removed before the treasure can be picked up.

     It will not be necessary to remember all of the symbols  and
their  meanings.   A simple command;  the '/';  will identify any
character appearing on your map.  See the section on commands for
further help.

1 TOWN
     The town level is where you will begin your adventure.   The
town  consists of six buildings each with an entrance, some towns
'people', and a wall which surrounds the town.   The  first  time
you  are  in  town it will be daytime, but you may return to find
that darkness  has  fallen.   (Note  that  some  spells  may  act
differently in the town level.)

2 Buildings
     You may enter any of the  stores,  if  they  are  open,  and
barter  with  the  owner for items you can afford.  But be warned
that the owners can easily be insulted, and may  even  throw  you
out  for a while if you insult them too often.  To enter a store,
simply move onto  the  entrance  represented  by  the  numbers  1
through 6.

     Once inside a store, his inventory will appear on the screen
along  with  a set of options for your character.  You may browse
the store's inventory if it takes more than one page to  display,
and  you  may  sell  or purchase items in his inventory.  You can
execute your inventory and equipment commands to see what you are
carrying.  Not shown with the options are the wear, take-off, and
exchange commands which will also work, but were excluded to keep
the options simple.

     Stores do not always have everything in stock.  As the  game
progresses,  they  may  get new items so check from time to time.
Also, if you sell them an item, it may get  sold  to  a  customer
while  you  are  adventuring so don't always expect to be able to
get back anything you have sold.

     Store owners will not buy harmful or useless items.   If  an
object is unidentified, they will pay you some base price for it.
Once they have bought  it  they  will  immediately  identify  the
object.   If  it  is  a  good  object,  they will add it to their
inventory.  If it was a bad bargain, they simply throw  the  item
away.   In  any  case,  you  may receive some knowledge of the if
another is encountered.

3 Alchemy shop
     The Alchemy Shop deals in all manner of potions and scrolls.
The entrance to the Alchemy Shop is a '5'.

3 Armory
     The Armory is where the  town's  armor  is  fashioned.   All
sorts  of  protective  gear  may  be  bought  and sold here.  The
entrance to the Armory is a '2'.

3 General Store
     The  General  Store  sells  foods,  drinks,  some  clothing,
torches, lamps, oil, and spikes.  All of these items, and others,
can be sold back to the General store for money.  The entrance to
the General Store is a '1'.

3 Magic User's Shop
     The Magic User's Shop is  the  most  expensive  of  all  the
stores.   It  deals  in  all  sorts of rings, wands, amulets, and
staves.  The entrance to the Magic Shop is a '6'.

3 Temple
     The Temple deals in healing and restoration potions, as well
as  bless scrolls, word-of-recall scrolls, some approved priestly
weapons, etc.  The entrance to the Temple is a '4'.

3 Weaponsmith's Shop
     The Weaponsmith's Shop  is  where  the  town's  weapons  are
fashioned.   Hand  and  missile weapons may be purchased and sold
here, along with arrows, bolts, and shots.  The entrance  to  the
Weaponsmiths is a '3'.

2 Supplies
     Your character will begin his adventure with  some  supplies
already  on  him.   Use  the  Inventory 'i' command to check what
these supplies are.  It will be necessary to buy  other  supplies
before  continuing into the dungeon, however, so be sure to enter
each of the stores.

2 Townsmen
     The town contains many different kinds of people.  There are
the street urchins, young children who will mob an adventurer for
money, and seem  to  come  out  of  the  woodwork  when  excited.
Blubbering Idiots which are a constant anoyance, but not harmful.
Public drunks which wander about the town singing, and are of  no
threat to anyone.  Sneaky rogues, which hang about watching for a
likely victim to mug.  And finally, what town would  be  complete
without  a  swarm  of  half  drunk  warriors, who take offense or
become annoyed just for the fun of it.

     Most of the towns people should be avoided  by  the  largest
possible  distance  when  you wander from store to store.  Fights
will break out though, so be prepared.  Since your character grew
up  in  this  world  of  intrigue,  no  experience is awarded for
killing on the town level.
