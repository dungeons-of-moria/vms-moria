	In VMS 4.0 the following device driver bug is fixed:

	VAX/VMS Systems Dispatch, March 1985; AD-L034A-24
	Page 26
	Process hangs in LEF wait state

	This  bug was a problem in MORIA.  It was fixed by pausing just
	before requesting input via QIO.  If you are running VMS 4.0 or
	greater, you should  remove these pauses from IO.INC.  Comments
	showing what code should be removed are placed just before each
	affected section.  You may search for  'VMS 4.0'  to locate all
	of these sections.

	In addition, you should remove comments around a single line of
	code  in  MORIA.INC.   This line causes the player to hibernate
	one  second  for every twenty turns of resting performed, which
	keeps  a resting player from eating up the system's CPU.  Again
	there is a comment just before the affected line.
