# Moria 4.8

_The Dungeons of Moria_ is a single player dungeon simulation originally
written by Robert Alan Koeneke and first released in 1985. Moria has
inspired many other games including _Angband_ and perhaps the most famous
roguelike of all, _Diablo_!

This repository contains the original VMS Pascal source code as written
by Robert Alan Koeneke, and assistant programmers Jimmey Wayne Todd and
Gary D. McAdoo.



## Summary

The game of MORIA is a single player dungeon simulation. A player may choose
from a number of races and classes when creating their character, and then
'run' that character over a period of days, weeks, even months; attempting to
win the game by defeating the Balrog which lurks in the deeper levels. The
player will begin their adventure on the town level where they may acquire
supplies, weapons, armor, and magical devices by bartering with various shop
owners. After preparing for their adventure, the player can descend into the
dungeons of MORIA, where fantastic adventures await their coming!



_If you have any other version of VMS Moria than 4.43 and 4.8, then please get
